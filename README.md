# Structural-Prediction-of-Conotoxins




Abstract: 

Conotoxins or conopeptides are neurotoxic peptides produced by approximately 800 species of marine snails of the genus Conus, each producing between 100 and 200 of these. These are small compared to viper or spider venoms, composed of between 10-35 residues.

Given their high specificity, they have been used to determine the selectivity of certain drugs to ion channels. They have also been used in the synthesis of powerful analgesics that block the release of pain neurotransmitters, preventing their spread to the brain.

Objective: 

Perform structural prediction using AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold from primary sequences of five different conotoxin superfamilies (one from each family).

Conclution: 

The prediction models for the exposed conotoxins have little or acceptable reliability, due to two things; the low number of coverage sequences that are available, even though the default of both programs uses the number that provides the best prediction; and most conotoxins have several loops, thus making their prediction difficult.
